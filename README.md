# JSDOC_EXAMPLE
## Author : NELSON ZONGEZILE MALGAS
In this code, we have defined two object types, Student and Person, using the @typedef JSDoc annotation.

The Student object represents a student and has properties such as name, id, access, and isActive, which indicate the student's name, ID, access status, and activity status respectively.

The Person object represents a person and contains both personal information (info) and grades. The personal information includes properties like name, id, access, and isActive, while the grades are stored in the grades object with properties grade10, grade11, and grade12.

We also have a function called handleSubmit that accepts an action parameter. This function is used to submit or decline a submission based on the provided action.

Additionally, we have an array called handler that contains a list of numbers.

Lastly, we defined a class called MyClass that represents an instance of the class. It has a constructor method that takes in name and age parameters and sets them as properties of the class instance. The class also has getter and setter methods for retrieving and updating the name and age values.

NB !!! This is just a practice example for JSDoc
